# Contributing to soroban-forge

Thanks for helping! This project is deliberately structured so five people (or
five hundred) can work in parallel with minimal merge conflicts.

## Module ownership map

| module | paths | owner | subcommand |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 — CLI core & command framework | `crates/core`, `src/main.rs` | Person A | routing, `forge.toml`, errors |
| 2 — Project scaffolding & templates | `crates/scaffold`, `templates/` | Person B | `new` |
| 3 — Test harness generator | `crates/testgen` | Person C | `test-init` |
| 4 — CI/CD & DevOps presets | `crates/ci-presets`, `presets/` | Person D | `ci-init` |
| 5 — Docs, examples & DX | `crates/doctor`, `docs/`, `examples/` | Person E | `doctor` |
| 6 — TypeScript bindings generator | `crates/bindings-ts` | Person F | `bindings ts` |

Rules of the road:

- **Stay inside your module.** The only shared code is `crates/core`; changes
  there need sign-off from Person A (they affect everyone).
- Each module keeps its **own README** (what it owns, its public surface, how
  to test it) and its **own tests**.
- Modules never depend on each other — only on `soroban-forge-core`. The one
  exception: testgen's *dev*-dependency on scaffold, used to test against
  freshly generated projects.

## How the plugin interface works

A module is a crate exposing one type that implements `ForgePlugin`
(see `crates/core/src/plugin.rs`):

```rust
pub trait ForgePlugin {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;      // subcommand name
    fn command(&self) -> clap::Command;  // clap definition
    fn run(&self, matches: &ArgMatches, ctx: &ForgeContext) -> Result<()>;
}
```

Adding a whole new module = new crate + one `Box::new(...)` line in
`src/main.rs`.

## Development

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

End-to-end check (what CI runs):

```sh
cargo run -- new demo --template token
cd demo && cargo test && cd .. && rm -rf demo
```

Working on templates or presets? They are embedded into the binary at compile
time (`include_dir`), so just edit the files under `templates/` or `presets/`
and rebuild. Do **not** rename `Cargo.toml.hbs` files to `Cargo.toml` — cargo
would treat the template as a real package.

## Ground rules

- **Never invent Soroban/Stellar APIs.** Check the
  [official docs](https://developers.stellar.org) or docs.rs for
  [soroban-sdk](https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk); if unsure, mark it
  `// TODO(verify)` and say so in the PR.
- soroban-forge **wraps official tooling** (stellar-cli), it never
  reimplements building/deploying.
- Generated output must work out of the box: templates compile and pass
  tests, workflows pass `actionlint`.
- No secrets in code or generated files — workflows reference GitHub secrets
  only.
- Plugins report failures by returning `Err(ForgeError::...)`, never by
  calling `std::process::exit` themselves — the binary derives the process
  exit code from the error variant (see
  [docs/exit-codes.md](docs/exit-codes.md)), and a plugin exiting directly
  would bypass that.

## Picking up work

[ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) lists scoped starter issues per module, tagged
`trivial` / `medium` / `high`. Comment on the GitHub issue to claim it. PRs
should include tests and update the owning module's README when the public
surface changes.
